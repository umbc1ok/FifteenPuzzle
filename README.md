# FifteenPuzzle

This is a repository for a **Artifficial Intelligence and Expert Systems** course taught at **Technical University of Lodz**.

The goal was to make a Fifteen Puzzle solver using 3 different alogrithms:
* DFS (Depth First Search)
* BFS (Breadth First Search)
* A* (A star)

On top of that, we were supposed to gather and analyze a bunch of statistics including program's runtime and number of processed states.
